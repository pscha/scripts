#scripts#
=========
This is a repository for those scripts I use often myself and which I find quite
usefull . 

touchpad_toggle
---------------
a script I wrote to swich off my touchpad so I don't accidentally move the mouse
or change the position where I'm typing. 
It changes the configuration on xinput so the touchpad is turned off, when it is
currently turned on and vice versa.

bildschirm
----------
a script which I copied from Emanuel Duss and extended by different usecases.
It adds output to an external output.

dvdplay
-------
a small script to play dvd's with mplayer (as I'm lazy and don't want to type in
all the options all of the time.)

alert.sh
--------
a script that uses dzen2 to display a message if a long running thing has
completed

background.sh
-------------
a wallpaper change script that uses feh to change the wallpaper to a random one
out of a wallpaper directory

status.sh
---------
a script that gives a warning with dzen2 if the battery is running low
