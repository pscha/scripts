scripts
=======
This is a repository for those scripts I use often myself and which I find quite
usefull . 

touchpad_toggle
---------------
a script I wrote to swich off my touchpad so I don't accidentally move the mouse
or change the position where I'm typing. 
It changes the configuration on xinput so the touchpad is turned off, when it is
currently turned on and vice versa.

bildschirm
----------
a script which I copied from Emanuel Duss and extended by different usecases.
It adds output to an external output.
